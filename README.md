## Usage Guide

Follow these steps to use MCG:

### 1. Prepare Base Configuration

### 2. Import MCG Script

- **For M.P.**:
  1. Go to "Override" in the sidebar and import the MCG script.
  2. Edit and save the override if needed.
  3. In "Subscription Management," select the subscription to modify, and set the MCG script as the override.
  
- **For Other Clients (e.g., C.V.R.)**:
  1. Navigate to the configuration page.
  2. Add the MCG script content into the configuration editor.
  3. Save and enable the script.

### 3. Apply and Update Configuration

- For **M.P.**, changes apply automatically after importing the script.
- For other clients, manually update or reload the configuration if necessary.

### 4. Verify the Configuration

Check your client’s execution log to ensure the MCG script is applied successfully.
